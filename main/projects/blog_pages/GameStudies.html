        <h3>Natural and significance of play as a cultural phenomenon.</h3>

        <b style="font-family:Georgia; font-size: 28px;">W</b>hy we play? (According to biology, psychology, and philosophy circa 1938)
        <p>
            All animals play. The play was a tool for learning the necessary skills for survival. When it comes to
            humans, play was helpful to practice skills to adulthood. Another theory, we learn to practice for strength. For
            better control of our own actions and do not hurt others. We also could begin playing to satisfy our desire to
            dominate and compete. Maybe we instinctively try to imitate our elders. Some claims are just for relaxation or release of
            energy. Huizinga “The fun of playing resists all analysis, all logical interpretation”.
        </p>
        The five characteristics of play by Johan Huizinga. (The profit one was ignored) 
        <p>
            • Play must be voluntary. One must have the freedom to play. Freedom is play.<br>
            • Play is separated from real life. <br>
            • Play is pretend. <br>
            However, play should be taken seriously. " Play may rise
            to heights of beauty and sublimity that leave seriousness far beneath...play adorns life, amplifies it". Play
            has tension challenges, and rules that create order. “These rules are a very important factor. All play has its
            rules. They determine what ‘holds’ in the temporary world circumscribed by play. The rules of a game are
            absolutely binding and allow no doubt”. <br>
            • Play require a playground, a locality and duration or start and end. Play has a repetition quality. Which in
            the modern world we call it “Core Gameplay Loop”. The local could be in reality, a digital environment or in our
            minds. In these spaces, the rules of the game apply. Not of the real world. "The arena, the card-table, the magic
            circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis court, the court of justice...are all in form and function of
            playgrounds. Forbidden sports, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain. All are
            temporary worlds within the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of and act or part". More of
            Huizinga about spaces and what we call of “The magic circle”. “Formally speaking, there is no distinction whatever between
            marking out a space, for a sacred purpose, and marking it out for purposes of sheer play.”

        <h3> Play and contest as civilizing functions</h3>

        <p>
            The relations between culture, religion and more have become deeply obscure. Except to the careful observer.
            “The
            player wins at something more than the game... They have won esteem, obtained honor; and this honor and
            esteem at once accrue to the benefit of the group to which the victor belongs... success won readily passes from the
            individual to the group.” the seasonal interactions of tribes between one another to compete, lies on the
            domain of playfulness. They helped to create a more structured government later on each civilization development.

            Play and War. “Ever since words existed for fighting and playing, people have been wanting to call war a
            game.” Johan Huizinga.
