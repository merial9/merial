### Notes about LMD
The age of Romanitas was before you. Now the majority in the land are saxons, even though you are the ruler and they don't come to you.

Arthur(Player) feels nostalgic about the good old days of the romanitas.

#### Arthur quotes
	1. wouldn't it be glorious if we humans could fight our wars with songs instead of spears
